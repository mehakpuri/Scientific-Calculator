# Scientific-Calculator

- A Scientific Calculator is designed to calculate the problems in math, science and engineering. They generally have many more features    than a standard four or five function calculator like calculating sine, cosine etc or finding factorial or square root of a number etc. They are widely used in situations that require quick access to certain mathematical functions.

- This Scientific Calculator consists of one file that uses tkinter and math module and a lot of their functions to create a calculator.

1. The tkinter module of is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the fastest and easiest way to create the GUI applications. Here we have created a layout of a common scientific calculator using Tk() class as well as Frames, Buttons and Layout and
various other widgets.

2. We have also used math module which is a standard module in Python and is always available. We have used various functions of this module like eval (for evaluating a mathematical expression), sqrt (for calculating square root), factorial etc.
